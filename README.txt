RULES:
Basics:
	There are two players, one on each side of the
board. There are four tokens in each of the six slots, 
and two stores on either side. 
	Players take turns picking up tokens and playing 
them on the board in a counterclockwise direction. A token 
is dropped in each slot as the player moves the tokens. When 
the player reaches their store, they place a token into it. 
If the last token they're holding is placed in the store, the
player gains an additional turn. 
	If there are more seeds left after the player puts it
into their store, they continue onto the opponent's side of 
the board counterclockwise until they run out of tokens. The
player does not put a token into the opponent's store if they
reach it. They continue onto their side of the board until 
they are out of tokens.
	The game is over when either most of the tokens on
the board are captured or all tokens are captured.

Capture Mode:
	When a token lands in an empty slot and there are
tokens in the slot on the opposite side, the player collects
the tokens in both slots and puts them into their store.
This does not grant the player another turn.

Avalanche Mode:
	When a token lands in a slot with one or more
tokens, the player picks up all of the tokens and continues
around the board until their last seed lands in their store
or in an empty slot.
